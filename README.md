node-markup.js-express
======================

A [Markup.js](https://github.com/adammark/Markup.js/) template engine implementation for express, since it was still missing.

[Markup.js](https://github.com/adammark/Markup.js/) is a leightweight but powerful templating alternative to mustache or other.

This library is inspired by the mustache template engine implementation [node-mustache-express](https://github.com/bryanburgers/node-mustache-express).
